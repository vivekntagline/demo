# Dynamic Form with Table Operations  

## Overview  
This project is a simple web-based **Form & Table system** that allows users to **add, edit, delete, search, and sort data dynamically** using JavaScript. All operations are performed using **arrays**, ensuring optimized and clean code.  

## Features  
âœ… **Dynamic Form:** Users can enter Name, Email, Gender, Hobbies, Age, State, and City.  
âœ… **Static Data Display:** A pre-defined array initializes the table with sample records.  
âœ… **State & City Dropdowns:** Selecting a state dynamically updates the city dropdown.  
âœ… **Add & Update Records:** Users can submit new entries or update existing ones.  
âœ… **Delete Functionality:** Users can remove records from the table.  
âœ… **Form Validations:** Includes required fields, radio button validation, checkbox validation, dropdown validation, and more.  
âœ… **Search Feature:** Google-like search functionality filters results dynamically.  
âœ… **Sorting Option:** Users can sort records in **Ascending & Descending order** based on Name.  

## How It Works  
1. **Form Submission**  
   - Users enter data and submit the form.  
   - Data is saved in an array and displayed in the table with a timestamp.  
2. **Edit & Update**  
   - Clicking **Edit** fills the form with existing data.  
   - The **Submit button changes to Update**, and a **Cancel button appears**.  
   - Clicking **Update** saves the changes, and clicking **Cancel** resets the form.  
3. **Delete**  
   - Clicking **Delete** removes the entry from the table.  
4. **Search & Sorting**  
   - The search box filters results dynamically as the user types.  
   - The sorting dropdown allows sorting records in ascending or descending order.  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML** â€“ Structure of the form and table.  
- **CSS** â€“ Basic styling for layout and responsiveness.  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** â€“ Handles form submission, validation, array operations, event listeners, search, and sorting.  

## Installation & Usage  
1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.  
3. Start entering records in the form and explore the functionalities.  

## Notes  
- **All operations are handled using JavaScript arrays** (No backend required).  
- **Code is structured cleanly**, ensuring no duplication of logic.  
- **Proper validation messages** are displayed for incorrect inputs.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add **local storage** support to persist data.  
- Implement a **backend API** for real-time data storage.  
- Enhance **UI/UX** with better styling and animations.
